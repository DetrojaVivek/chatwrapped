                    You agree not to misuse the service. You are responsible for the chat files you upload.
                    Please ensure you have the consent of the other party in the chat before analyzing private
                    conversations.
                    Abuse of the platform, including attempting to upload malicious files, will result in immediate

                    pricing page.
                    We reserve the right to modify pricing or features, though existing premium users will generally be
                    grandfathered into the features they paid for.
